✅ How a Very Good Student Approaches This Assignment
Think of this project in four layers:

🔵 LAYER 1: Understand the Business First (Before SQL, Before Metabase)
A strong student does not jump into writing queries.

They first ask:
“What does a toy retailer care about?”

Typical KPI areas:

Sales performance (daily/weekly/monthly)

Best-selling products

Store performance differences

Profitability (margin analysis)

Inventory levels (overstock, stockout risks)

Seasonal demand patterns

Slow-moving products

👉 This helps you know what insights you’re trying to create before writing any SQL.

🔵 LAYER 2: Understand the Data Structure
Before creating schema or dashboards, understand:

✔ Products
– Product name
– Category
– Cost
– Price
– Profit margin

✔ Stores
– Store name
– Location
– Region

✔ Sales
– Daily sales
– Quantity sold
– Revenue calculation

✔ Inventory
– Stock levels per store
– Replenishment needs

A good student draws a simple diagram:

scss
Copy code
Products (1) ---- (many) Sales
Products (1) ---- (many) Inventory
Stores (1) ---- (many) Sales
Stores (1) ---- (many) Inventory
👉 This makes it easy to build your schema.

🔵 LAYER 3: Think Like a Data Engineer (Building Schema)
Your mindset should be:

Where is the primary key?
Products → product_id
Stores → store_id
Sales → sale_id
Inventory → inventory_id

Where do foreign keys connect?
Sales.product_id → Products.product_id
Sales.store_id → Stores.store_id
Inventory.product_id → Products.product_id
Inventory.store_id → Stores.store_id

Is the schema clean?

No duplicate columns

Datatypes correct

Keys well defined

👉 A good schema makes SQL and dashboards easy.

🔵 LAYER 4: Think Like a Data Analyst (SQL + Metabase Insights)
Here’s how a top student thinks:

✔ SQL Thinking
Ask yourself:

What insights does the business want?

Which columns are needed?

Which tables do I join?

What aggregation? (SUM, AVG, COUNT)

What time grouping? (day, month, year)

Example mindset (not the answer):

“To get total revenue, I need quantity × price.
So I must join Sales with Products.”

✔ Metabase Thinking
A good student plans:

3 dashboards:

Sales Performance Dashboard

Total revenue

Sales trend

Top stores

Best-selling products

Inventory Health Dashboard

Low-stock alerts

Overstock products

Stockout forecast

Profitability Dashboard

Profit per product

Product category margin

Store-level profitability

Interactive features:

Filters for date, store, category

Drill-down cards

Custom SQL for complex KPIs

⭐ WHAT REALLY MATTERS TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT LIKE A PRO
Here is the checklist of what high-performing students do:

✔ 1. Create a clean schema
Well-defined PK, FK, sensible datatypes.

✔ 2. Document the schema in a simple diagram
Nothing fancy — even a text-based diagram is enough.

✔ 3. Write meaningful SQL queries
Not random queries — business-driven insights.

✔ 4. Use both Custom Questions + SQL in Metabase
Shows you understand both methods.

✔ 5. Build 2–3 dashboards that tell a story
A good dashboard:

Has a title

Has 4–8 cards

Uses filters

Tells a business story

✔ 6. Explain insights (even if short)
Example:

“Store 12 has high sales but low profit due to high discounting.”

This shows analytical thinking — the most important part.
If I were doing the assignment, I would follow this exact roadmap:
DAY 1 — Understand Data & Business

Read table columns

Draw schema

Brainstorm KPIs

DAY 2 — Create Database & Schema

Create PK & FK

Insert sample data

Start exploring SQL

DAY 3 — Build SQL Queries

Sales metrics

Profit metrics

Inventory metrics

DAY 4 — Build Metabase Dashboards

Add filters

Organize cards

Make it visual

DAY 5 — Final Touch

Clean design

Brief documentation

Screenshots of dashboards
